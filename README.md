# Brain Stroke Analysis

A Brain Stroke is a condition when the supply of blood to a portion of the brain is interrupted. The brain cells thus begin to die. It is critical and needs to be given immediate treatment. Brain stroke causes several
symptoms such as trouble walking, speaking, and understanding, as well as paralysis or numbness of the face, arm, or leg. According to the 
World Health Organization (W.H.O), about 15 million people suffer stroke worldwide yearly. 

This repository aims at building a predictive model that helps in identifying whether a patient is likely to suffer from a brain stroke. 
The highlights of this repository are as follows:
- Dataset imbalance dealt with the help of resampling technique of "Upscaling"
- 5 algorithms are used for the prediction - Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Support Vector Classifier
- There are 2 best performing models as a result of the Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithm with 99.35% and 98.19% accuracy respectively
- False-positive rate for Random Forest proves to be much better than the rest of the algorithms


<b>Note</b>: The Dataset for this project has been attached to this repository as well as the current version can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)
