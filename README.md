# Brain Stroke Analysis
A Brain Stroke is a condition when the supply of blood to a portion of the brain is interrupted. This prevents the brain tissues from getting 
oxygen and nutrients. The brain cells thus begin to die. It is critical and needs to be given immediate treatment. Brain stroke causes several
symptoms such as trouble walking, speaking, and understanding, as well as paralysis or numbness of the face, arm, or leg. According to the 
World Health Organization (W.H.O), about 15 million people suffer stroke worldwide yearly. Out of these 15 million, about 5 million die, and 
5 million are permanently paralyzed. High blood pressure is our mortal enemy who is contributing to more than 12.7 million strokes worldwide.

This notebook aims at building a predictive model that helps in identifying whether a patient is likely to suffer from a brain stroke.
